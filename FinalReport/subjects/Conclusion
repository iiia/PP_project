1. Seaching with parrallelized alpha-beta prunning may get a different result from the oridinary alpha-beta prunning. This may due to the cut off position of the search. By parrallelized alpha-beta, we divide our search tree and search in different thread. We may find a score that's as same score as the one we shall find with non-parrallelized search and return it, while non-parrallelized search may have cut off.
